# ABC University Course Management Console Application - Runtime Analysis & Code Implementation
### Southern New Hampshire University - Computer Science 300 - Course Final Projects
&nbsp;


## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The projects in this course centered on solving problems involving data structures and algorithms. Project One focused on analyzing the runtime and memory usage of various data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Project Two involved sorting and displaying a list of Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order.

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To approach each problem, I first thoroughly understood the requirements and selected the most appropriate data structure based on the problemâ€™s unique characteristics. Mastering data structures is essential for efficient data handling and effective problem-solving. I applied techniques such as algorithm implementation and code optimization for both performance and memory efficiency.

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
One challenge I encountered was grasping the intricacies of different data structures and their implementation details. I overcame this by reviewing class notes, exploring online resources, and consulting with peers and instructors. In Project Two, a specific hurdle involved implementing the sorting algorithm correctly. I addressed this by breaking down the task into smaller components, testing each one individually, and then integrating them into a functional solution.
